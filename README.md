# Tic-Tac-Toe
Its the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using python! Battle against your mates and enjoy!<br />
The instructions for playing the game are simple and will be displayed each time the players wish to play it!<br />
But I am still listing them out!<br /><br />
> This is a 2-player game where player1 will be X, and the player2 will be O<br />
> Each player will get a chance to insert their letter into the grid alternatively,starting from player1<br />
> The one who fills either a row,a column or a diagonal with his/her letter first wins!<br />
> If any of the players is unable to do so, the game would be considered a draw!<br /><br />
Enjoy!<br />
